# Drowsiness-Detection-with-OpenCV
Drowsiness detection is a technology that is used to prevent riders from falling asleep during driving. This technology brings protection to riders and co-passengers. By using an IR Camera in Infront of the driver, the algorithm can monitor the area enclosed between the eyes of the driver. When the area falls under curtain measurement for several consecutive frames then the system triggers an alarm to warn the driver to take control of the vehicle. When the driver opens back their eyes and the area goes above the safe region the alarm stops. Thus, this could stop the driver from dozing and save lives.
